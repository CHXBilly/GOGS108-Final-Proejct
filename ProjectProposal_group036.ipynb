    "To what extent does the use of social media negatively impact the mental health, specifically depression, loneliness, self-harm, suicide rates, and anxiety of teenagers and young adults in the United States? Does this affect a certain gender more? (Not sure yet if we want to focus on one or multiple mental health aspects depending on the data we gather)"

    "I (Marc Isaia) study Cognitive Science and Clinical Psychology. As a result I have taken relevant coursework at UCSD pertaining to our research question. Said coursework includes: Clinical Psychology, Psychological Disorders of Childhood, Clinical Assessment and Treatment, Neuroanatomy and Physiology, Brain Disorders and Cognition, and Statistics. Like Gabriel, I have also noticed negative effects social media usage has caused me as well as my peers. After deleting my social media applications I experience a decrease in social anxiety symptoms. \n \n We are a part of the generation that first started to heavily use and rely on social media for our connections to peers and the outside world. We personally have experienced the negative effects it has had on our own mental health and have found several examples of research papers and articles online that corroborate our own experiences. Personally I (Gabriel Beal), like many other teens and young adults, definitely feel I have an unhealthy level of addiction to my phone that I am currently trying to break but it is incredibly difficult. I have tried to lower my usage of social media over the past year but I am still guilty of comparing myself to others online or constantly checking for likes and experiencing anxiety whenever I occasionally post generally due to worrying about what others will think. \n \n Similarly, I (Daniela Molina) have found that taking time off of social media, or limiting my screen time, has resulted in decreased levels of anxiety, higher confidence levels, and an overall better mood and well-being.

    "The ideal dataset would consist of at least 30,000 observations consisting of an individual’s identity, such as gender and age, how many social media apps they use on a regular basis as well as which ones, and their average daily screen time spent on these apps. It would also include whether they feel that social media has had a positive, negative or neutral overall impact on their mental health and what they would rate their current mental health state. Ideally, this dataset would be collected through surveys or studies on teenagers with different levels of social media use, and be organized in a csv or json dataset. We plan on collecting data of our own through a survey we create and post on various platforms."

    "We feel the privacy of individuals is extremely important for this topic. Mental health is a very sensitive subject for a majority of people so we only want to use data that was collected ethically and with the permission of the individuals. In regards to social media usage those figures are publicly available but in order to fully explore the hypothesis we would need to correlate an individual’s mental health state and their individual usage of social media which again we feel the need for individual consent is a priority."
